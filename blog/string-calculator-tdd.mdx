## Inspiration

`Test Driven Development` or `TDD` is something I was hearing a lot but didn't fully understand.

This little project is my way of exploring and learning it's fundamentals.

## What it does

StringCalculatorTDD is a project created for TDD beginners as a solution for [TDD Kata 1 - String Calculator](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   You have installed the latest version of `java, testng, maven`

## Exploring StringCalculatorTDD

To explore StringCalculatorTDD, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/StringCalculatorTDD
cd StringCalculatorTDD
code . # Or any other of your favorite editor
```

## Using StringCalculatorTDD

After cloning the project one good way to learn from it would be using git history.

Just do a `git log` and look at the changes, you can go through the entire process of TDD one step at a time.

## How it was built

StringCalculatorTDD was built using `Java` and `TestNG`, the IDE used was `Eclipse`.

## Challenges faced

Wrapping my head around the laws of TDD, which are:

-   You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
-   You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail.
-   You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass one failing test.

## What I learned

I learned why TDD is used and how it helps us in producing, bug free maintainable code.

The cycle of TDD is somewhat as such:

-   Write a failing unit test
-   Write code to pass the test
-   Refactor if necessary

I also learned about TestNG, which is a more feature rich equivalent of JUnit.

## What's next

Probably use TDD in more of my future projects.
